**Notes:**

* During the testing phase, you can use a combination of your POC wallet balance and Credit wallet balance to initialize resources on the VKS system. Specifically, you can use your POC wallet balance to initialize Nodes (VM) and PVC Volumes for your Cluster. In addition, you can use the Credit wallet balance that we provide to initialize Snapshots, ALBs, and NLBs, respectively.
* Due to being in the Alpha phase, this feature may be unstable or not have all the features of the official version.
* VNG Cloud may change or discontinue this feature at any time without prior notice.
* Please use this feature with caution and report any bugs or issues you encounter to VNG Cloud.
