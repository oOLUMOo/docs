# Release notes

## \[<mark style="color:green;">**Feature**</mark>] May 30, 2024 <a href="#april_19_2024" id="april_19_2024"></a>

We are pleased to announce the **General Availability** (GA) release of the VNGCloud Kubernetes Service (VKS). In addition to the features we have provided in previous releases, this GA release brings several new features and enhancements to users. Here are the details of the update:

**New Features:**

* **Re-activate:** VKS allows you to make a system request to automatically recreate the default Service Account if you accidentally delete or change the information of the previously created default Service Account. The default Service Account is the Service Account that the VKS system automatically creates when you start working with VKS. We will use this Service Account to create resources for your Cluster.
* **Event History:** VKS will display the history of events that occur when users work with a Cluster or Node Group. This will be a way for you to monitor the activities happening to your Cluster, thus limiting abnormal activities from occurring.
* **Volume:** VKS has integrated a display of the list of Volumes in the Resource Tab, helping you easily manage the Volumes that are attached to your Cluster.
* **Load Balancer:** VKS has integrated a display of the list of Load Balancers in the Resource Tab, helping you easily manage the Load Balancers that are being used for your Cluster.

**Improvements:**

* **Performance:** VKS has optimized the performance of Cluster creation. Specifically, in the Alpha version, the time from when you start creating a Cluster (with Default Node Group) to when the Cluster transitions to **ACTIVE** state is around 4:00s to 4:30s. Currently, this time has been optimized to <mark style="color:red;">**2:30s to 3:00s**</mark> depending on the Cluster and the time you create it.
* **Manage Image:** VKS will automatically delete unused images when the disk usage reaches the usage limit (usage/quota ratio >= 85%).
* **In addition**, we have improved a few other issues in this GA release:
  * Changed the way **Node Names** are named to make it easier for you to use and manage your Cluster. Specifically, the Node Name will have additional information Cluster Name, Node Group Name.
  * Removed **User Builder** on User's Worker Node.
  * Changed the **SSH** mechanism from Port 22 to Port 234.

If you encounter any problems with this GA release, please contact VKS support for assistance.
