# K8S Flavor

In a Kubernetes cluster, the "flavor" configuration is often referred to as the "node instance type" or "node profile". This is a hardware resource configuration for the Kubernetes Cluster with resource-specific options such as CPU, RAM, and GPU that you can choose to configure for the Master Node and Minion Node in your cluster. This configuration determines the performance and load capacity of the nodes in the cluster.

**Master Node Flavor:** The Master Node is the central management of the Kubernetes cluster and does not run product applications. Therefore, less resources are required compared to Worker Node.

* CPU and RAM: The Master Node needs less CPU and RAM resources as it mainly performs the management and coordination of the Worker Node.
* GPU: K8S is mainly focused on the management and delivery of applications and services, so the GPU is rarely used, but there are a few cases where the GPU is required to perform graphics, machine learning, processing tasks. big data and many other tasks

**Minion Node Flavor:** Worker Node runs the application's containers and must have enough resources to support them.

* CPU and RAM: This configuration depends on the number and type of containers you want to run on each Minion Node. Provide enough CPU and RAM resources to ensure the performance of the application.
* GPU: K8S is mainly focused on management and delivery of applications and services, so it rarely uses GPU, but there are some cases that require GPU to perform graphics, machine learning, processing tasks. big data and many other tasks\
  It should be noted that the flavor profile must be tailored to the specific requirements of the application and the capabilities of the system resources. An improper configuration can lead to poor performance or application failure in your Kubernetes cluster.

VNG Cloud K8S provides Flavors suitable for a variety of needs so that users can choose according to the table below:
