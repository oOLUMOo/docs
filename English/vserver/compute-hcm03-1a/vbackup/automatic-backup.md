# Automatic Backup

The automatic backup feature is a crucial part of the backup service, making it easy for users to protect their data without needing to perform complex manual steps. With this feature, after you have created a backup on the server, the system will automatically activate the automatic backup mode. It will then continue to create backups according to the scheduled plan until the user decides to turn off this feature.
