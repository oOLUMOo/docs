# vBackup

vBackup is VNG Cloud's full backup service that protects your data, enabling automation of disk backups on virtual servers and storing them in the cloud. When using vBackup, you can centrally configure backup policies and monitor backup activity for VNG Cloud resources including creating automatic daily, weekly, and monthly backups. Each backup is a full file-based snapshot of your volume taken within the preferred scheduled time frame based on your policies while the virtual server is still running. This means that the Backup service is uninterrupted and offers you several complete restore options. vBackup automates and consolidates previously performed service-by-service backup tasks, eliminating the need to create custom scripts and time-consuming manual processes, allowing you to meet your regulatory and business backup compliance requirements.

**Description of ingredients:**

* Portal: where to receive, manage when to perform backup / restore and the life cycle of backups according to the convention that users provide, which follows the following logic
* The object of the backup declaration is a vServer instance (single) but may or may not include all the Volumes attached to the instance. The volume of backup volumes at a time can be more than 1 which should ensure near-simultaneous snapshots
* vBackup service: is a backend service responsible for receiving two main actions, backup or restore from the Portal, and is responsible for optimally managing the storage space of an instance's life cycle and accompanying volumes. Further, it will be responsible for executing the most recent integrated tasks, which is to release vStorage as a "Backup Location" to support the starting point.
* vSnapshot service: is a service with the idea of managing snapshots to centralize this role at one point, beyond operations on snapshots will be able to cover all snapshots that the system creates for multiple purposes (Ex vSnapshot can can rollback snapshots generated by vbackup but still managed by vSnapshot)
* Message Queue: using rabbitmq as a message exchange channel is not too much of a specific explanation in this component, but the component mainly serves messages to communicate between apis if any, not for distributed backup jobs model.
* Backup Worker: are the edge services of vBackup distributed in the Regions responsible for executing Export/Import commands from Storage to a Cephfs and other data manipulation tasks in the future (Ex. compress, encrypt, zip) , generate download archive, migrate amazon...)
* vStorage: backup location will support in the early stages then can be other options on-cloud or on-premise location.
