# Create backups immediately (Back now)

The "Backup Now" feature allows you to perform an immediate data backup by clicking the "Backup Now" button for the Backup Server or Server you select. Typically, users may need to perform regular backups, but sometimes an immediate backup is necessary to protect critical data at that moment.

Benefits of Immediate Data Backup:

1. **Flexibility and Urgency:** Immediate data backup allows you to perform backups whenever you feel necessary, instead of waiting for the scheduled backup time. This is very useful in emergency situations or when you want to protect data immediately before a potential incident.
2. **Protecting Important Data Quickly:** If you only need to back up a small portion or a specific project, immediate backup helps you protect important data that you have just worked on.
3. **Quick Recovery:** When you need to recover data, you will have the most recent backup available.
