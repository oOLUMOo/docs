# Create backups for virtual servers using the administration interface

On vBackup's dashboard, the protected resources page will list all resources backed up at least once. If you are using vBackup for the first time then note that there will not be any resources (such as virtual machines or protected drives) listed on this page. At VNG Cloud, we support centralized data protection for virtual machines (Servers) in the cloud computing environment. You can back up the virtual machine and the data will be transferred to vStorage. However, what you need to do now is to create a backup session for your resources according to the instructions below:
