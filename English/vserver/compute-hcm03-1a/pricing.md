# Pricing

The Pricing Calculator is a web-based planning tool that you can use to create estimates for your vServer use cases. You can use it to model your solutions before building them, explore vServer service price points, and review the calculations behind your estimates. It helps you plan your spending, find cost-saving opportunities, and make informed decisions when using vServer.

The VNG Cloud Pricing Calculator is very useful for those who have never used vServer. It is also beneficial for those looking to reorganize or expand their vServer usage. You do not need any prior experience with vServer cloud to use the Pricing Calculator.

The Pricing Calculator is available through the web-based console at [VNG Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.console.vngcloud.vn/estimate?bid=64c7a367e2725513cbaf9a97).
