# Connections

VNG Cloud Interconnect allows you to establish a direct network connection between your network and VNG Cloud.

Currently, we offer the following type of connections:

*   Dedicated Connection: A physical Ethernet connection associated with a single customer, is a type of network connection where network resources are dedicated to a specific purpose or a specific customer. In this case, there is no resource sharing with other users or applications on the network. This ensures that the speed and bandwidth of the connection are maintained stable and unaffected by other users. Customers can request a dedicated connection through the VNG Cloud Interconnect dashboard or API. For more information, please refer to[ Dedicated Connection](create-a-dedicated-connection.md).\
