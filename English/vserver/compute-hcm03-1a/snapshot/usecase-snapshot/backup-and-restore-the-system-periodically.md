# Backup and restore the system periodically

In an international manufacturing and distribution corporation, the server system and data play a crucial role in maintaining continuous production processes and high-quality service. To ensure the safety and readiness of the system, they have established a regular backup and recovery process using the Snapshot feature.

Every day, during off-peak hours, the company automatically creates Snapshots for all their servers and critical volumes. This includes both production data and important transaction data related to inventory tracking and management.

These Snapshots are stored in a secure storage repository and maintained on a cycle. The company maintains a regular backup schedule and automatically deletes older Snapshots after a certain period to conserve storage resources.

One day, the main server system experienced an unexpected hardware failure, leading to the shutdown of the production system. The data on this server is crucial for inventory management and goods transportation.

In this situation, the company used the Snapshot feature to restore the server from the nearest backup version. They were able to quickly recover the data and operations of the transportation system, minimizing downtime and the risk of profit loss in the worst-case scenario.

Thanks to regular Snapshot usage, the company has protected the consistency of data and ensured quick readiness and recovery in case of emergencies. This helps them maintain production processes and services for their customers without major disruptions.
