# Develop and testing

Below is a usage case of utilizing Snapshot in the process of application development and testing:

In a large technology corporation, there is an ongoing project to develop a critical application. This project requires meticulous testing and validation of the application's reliability before deploying it to the production environment, as it involves managing the finances of millions of users.

**Creating Snapshot for Server:** The development team began the testing process by creating a Snapshot for the current virtual server, containing the application and test data. This ensures they have a copy of the test environment at the initial stage.

**Deploying New Version:** They proceeded to deploy a new version of the application on this virtual server to test integration, performance, and new features.

**Error Detection and Issues:** During testing, they discovered some minor errors and issues in the application, including performance-related problems and compatibility issues with certain browsers.

**Restoring from Snapshot:** To address these issues, the development team used the Snapshot feature to quickly restore the virtual server to its initial state. They could continue to make modifications, test, and experiment without worrying about impacting the production environment.

Thanks to the use of Snapshot, the development team was able to test and improve the application safely and efficiently. This helped ensure the stability and quality of the application before deploying it to end users and minimized the risk of impacting the corporation's finances and reputation.
