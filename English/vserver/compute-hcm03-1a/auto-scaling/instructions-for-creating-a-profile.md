# Instructions for creating a profile

At the profile management interface, select create profile

**Step 1:** Create a template for the instance. Here you will define the configuration values of an instance that you want the auto-scaling group to add/reduce when scaling.

Create a template that will include the following information: Profile / instance name, Image, Flavor, Volume, Network

The steps below describe how to enter information for the template

* **Profile & Instance name:** At Profile information, click and name the profile & instance, note only placing A->Z characters or numbers. Profile and instance names are limited to 6-20 characters
* **IMAGE:** Choose from the list of available OS. You can also select the list of images you have uploaded (instructions you can see here).
* **FLAVOR**
* **VOLUME**
* **NETWORK**

Corresponding to the parameters you choose for the template, you can see the reference price in the left corner with the information as shown below.

_**Note:** that this is just a reference price for the profile, VNDT will not charge any fees when you create a profile (template). Fees for using auto-scaling will be calculated based on your actual usage (total instance scale minutes) and paid at the end of the month. (See more at auto-scaling fee section)_

After entering all the information for the template, click Next to go to step 2 profile information

**Step 2**: Profile information (Optional)

The information in step 2 is not required, you can skip it if you don't need to use it.
