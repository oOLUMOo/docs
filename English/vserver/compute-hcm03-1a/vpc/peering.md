# Peering

VPC peering is a service in a cloud environment that allows direct connections between virtual private networks (VPCs) within the same cloud service provider. VPC peering allows data and resources to be transferred between VPCs safely, securely, and efficiently, just as if they were operating within the same intranet. This facilitates resource sharing, distributed application building, and provides flexibility in cloud infrastructure management.
