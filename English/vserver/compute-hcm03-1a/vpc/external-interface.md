### **Scenarios for External Interface** <a href="#externalinterface-scenariosforexternalinterface" id="externalinterface-scenariosforexternalinterface"></a>

Attaching an External Interface to an instance is useful when you want to:

* Have a direct IP address in OS for some special protocol (Eg SIPâ€¦)
* Build your own Firewall or VPN gateway with the instance that have internal and external interface
* Create a low-budget, high-availability solution.

### **External Interface basics** <a href="#externalinterface-externalinterfacebasics" id="externalinterface-externalinterfacebasics"></a>

You can create an external interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance. When you move a external interface from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected to the new instance.

You need to configure IP address for External Interface from within instance, static or DHCP configuration will work. You can only attach External Interface to Instance that is not associated with Floating IP.
