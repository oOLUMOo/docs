## 3. Organise your pages
Here are some tips for organising your content.


* Change the page order

The sidebar on the left displays your pages in a hierarchy. If you have Space Administrator permissions you can click "Space Tools" > "Reorder Pages" to move pages around.


* Add labels

Labels help keep pages organised and make it easier for you to find the information you need. Click "Labels" at the bottom of a page to add or edit. The "Related pages" section on this page uses labels too!


* Make templates

Standardise and speed up the page creation process with templates. You can create and format a template with page layouts, standard headings and instructional text for hints and guidelines. Check out our sample page on "[[Making a template|Making-a-template]]"
